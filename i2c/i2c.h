/**



- All "device" fields should be the 7 bit address of the device, with the low bit
    set to 0 (the 7 addres bits are the upper bits). This applies to both the
    Put (write) and Get (read) cases.

- Put and Get are based on I2C communication specification as described by ST in
  the LSM303DLHC and L3GD20 datasheets.
  
- Terms:

  + ST - Start
  + SAD - Slave Address (device)
  + SAK - Slave Acknowledge
  + SUB - SubAddress (slave register address)
  + SP - Stop
  + +W - plus write (lowest device bit set to 0)
  + +R - plus read (lowest device bit set to 1)
  + NMAK - Master No Acknowledge  
 
- I2C differs based on the device that you use. For functions that might be
  device specific, there is a reference indicator. These references are:
  
  + ST - ST Microelectronics, particularily the LSM303DLHC and L3GD20 devices.
  + MS - Measurement Specialties, particularily the MS5607 and MS5611 devices.
 
- If you're using the multibyte Get and Put with ST based devices, be sure to
  bitwise OR the register address with 0x80 (the MSb to 1) in order to turn on
  the auto-increment function (see datasheet for L3GD20 for example). This is
  not done automatically by this library.
