/** A multithreaded circular buffer.

This class implements a multithreaded circular buffer. When an instance is
created, a single circular buffer is created. Instances can then add to the
global buffer, and read from it. 

@warning: you can have only one buffer per project. You may have multiple views
on it (as represented by an instance of this class), but there is one a single
buffer for all the data.
