/** A multithreaded circular buffer.
 * 
 * This class implements a multithreaded circular buffer. When an instance is
 * created, a single circular buffer is created. Instances can then add to the
 * global buffer, and read from it. 
 * 
 * @warning: you can have only one buffer per compilation. You may have multiple
 * views on it (as represented by an instance of this class), but there is one a 
 * single buffer for all the data. If you want more then you'll have to make 
 * copies of the class.
 * 
 * Future Feature List:
 *      - make a version of Get that has timeout, and a version to get strings
 *      - make the "Put" functions static.
 *      - add a semaphore system to automatically deallocate the lock when the last instance is destroyed.
