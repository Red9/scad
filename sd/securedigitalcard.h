/** FAT16/32 SD card interface.
 * 
 * This class is based on the Spin version of FSRW 2.6 by Rokicki and Lonesock.
 * 
 * This object provides FAT16/32 file read/write access on a block device. Only 
 * one file can be open at a time. Open modes are 'r' (read), 'a' (append), 
 * 'w' (write), and 'd' (delete). Only the root directory is supported. No long 
 * filenames are supported. This object also supports traversing the root 
 * directory.
 * 
 * This object requires pullup resistors on the four SD card I/O lines. The 
 * pullup resistors should be approximately 10kOhms each.
 * 
 * The SPI DO, DI, and CLK lines can be shared with other SPI devices, as long 
 * as the @a Release() command is called after doing SD card activities and 
 * before doing other SPI activities. Note: this has not been tested at all.
 * 
 * Cluster size: If it's not 32768, it should be (32K clusters). To format a 
 * drive with FAT32 with 32K clusters, use the following command under linux:
 *     sudo fdisk -l
 *     sudo mkdosfs /dev/sdX -s 64 -F 32 -I
 * 
 * To check the filesystem under linux:
 *      sudo dosfsck -v /dev/sdX
 * 
 * Note: the mkdosfs command will format the entire disk, and erase all 
 * information on it.
 * 
 * If an exceptional error occurs then the @a HasError() function will return 
 * true. To see what went wrong, query the @a GetError() function. After you fix
 * the error, clear it with @a ClearError(); Every function may set the error,
 * although you're generally OK with just checking after @a Mount() and 
 * @a Open()
 * 
 * 
 * @todo(SRLM) :add the get Filesize method.
 * 
 * @warning Untested with multiple instances!!!
 * 
 * @warning The various @a Get() and @a Put() methods don't check to make sure
 * that a file is open. It's up to your code to make sure that a file is 
 * successfully opened before you need to use it.
 * 
 * @author SRLM (srlm@srlmproductions.com)
 * 
 * Possible improvements:
 * Write a function that gets a string:
 *       int   Get(char * Ubuf, char EndOfStringChar);
